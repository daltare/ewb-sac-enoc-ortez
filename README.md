### Sac Valley EWB Enoc Ortez 
Code to clean and format data from the initial assessment trip for Sac Valley EWB's Enoc Ortez (Nicaragua) project, and create a [web-based mapping tool](https://daltare.shinyapps.io/Enoc-Ortez-Assessment-Data/) to display a summary of the results. 

 Data formatting is done in the `format_data_enoc_ortez.R` script, and the code for the mapping tool is in the `Enoc_Ortez_app.R` script. All geospatial data used in the map is available in the `output_data` folder (in .gpkg format). Raw data used to create the geospatial data files (in the `input_raw_data` folder) is a compilation/summary of data from the field data collection forms that were provided by staff from EWB's Nicaragua office after their March 2021 assessment trip.
